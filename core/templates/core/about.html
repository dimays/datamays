      About Me
    </h1>
    <p class="text-text-secondary max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
      I grew up in northern Michigan in a home that valued curiosity, joy, and learning for its own sake.
      I was home-educated alongside my four older siblings, surrounded by books, music, mathematics, and language.
      This environment shaped who I am, how I think, and how I work.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">My Approach</h2>
    <p class="text-text-secondary max-w-3xl leading-relaxed">
      I tackle problems by understanding them deeply, designing clear solutions, and iterating with care.
      I document my work thoughtfully, build reusable systems, and enjoy helping others understand
      complex concepts.
